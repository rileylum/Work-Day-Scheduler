# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

A simple calendar app that allows you to record important tasks for your work day!

In this project I have used bootstrap to style the page, Javascript to dynamically generate the content (including using localStorage to have saved data persist between page refreshes) and MomentJS to get the current time.

![*The webpage includes a header with the current time and a set of rows depicting tasks for each hour of the work day*](*add image src link*)

## Usage

Add important tasks for each hour of your work day by entering the details into the textboxes. Click the save button to save that particular task, saved tasks will persist between page loads (NOTE: this uses localStorage so will not persist between browsers or computers or if the localStorage is cleared).

Each time block will be highlighted in the following fashion: 
- Grey for the past
- Red for the present
- Green for the future
